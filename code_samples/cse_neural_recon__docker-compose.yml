# Docker Compose for Neural 3D Reconstruction Training
# Supports multi-GPU training with resource isolation
#
# Usage:
#   # Build the image
#   docker compose build
#
#   # Train on GPU 0 (default)
#   docker compose up train
#
#   # Train on specific GPU
#   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 docker compose up train
#
#   # Run comparison benchmark
#   docker compose up benchmark
#
#   # Interactive shell with GPU access
#   docker compose run --rm shell
#
#   # Train on multiple GPUs (if available)
#   docker compose up train-multi
